# Zero to Hero Request: "The Blues Harmonica" Shed
 
 **Workflow Activation**: Please initiate the **Zero to Hero Workflow** (Phase 1).
 
 ## Vision: "The Blues Shed"
 I want to build the ultimate modern web hub for Blues Harmonica disciples (Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Jason Ricci era). This uses grit and soul as a hook but delivers a **pristine, high-fidelity learning experience**. Think "Crossroads" meets MasterClass. It should blend smoky juke joint vibes with 2024 audio visualization and interactivity.
 
 ## Core Objective
 Create a "Hero" quality application that serves as the definitive woodshed for practicing, learning, and mastering the blues harp.
 
 ## Key Features Required
 1.  **" The Lick Library" (Database)**: A visually stunning, interactive library of famous riffs. Users can filter by artist, difficulty, or position (Cross Harp vs Straight Harp).
 2.  **Web-Based Virtual Monitor**: A real-time pitch detection and bending visualization tool. See your bends hit the "blue notes" in real-time.
 3.  **" The Jam Room"**: A backing track player that lets you change keys and tempos on the fly without artifacts.
 4.  **" The Amp Room"**: A tube-amp simulator UI where users can tweak settings on virtual '59 Bassmans or Tweeds to understand tone shaping.
 5.  **EXTRA EXCITING FEATURE: "The AI Call & Response"**: An intelligent session player that plays a lick and listens for you to repeat it, grading your timing and intonation.
 
 ## Aesthetics & Design Language
 -   **Vibe**: "Midnight Juke Joint". Dark mode default. Deep indigos, smoky charcoals, warm tungsten glows. Wood grain and tweed textures.
 -   **Typography**: Vintage poster fonts (e.g., woodblock styles) for headers, clean serif or humanist sans (e.g., Lora or Inter) for readable tabs/text.
 -   **Interactivity**: Tube glow effects on hover, analog VU meter animations, responsive wave visualizations.
 
 ## Technical Constraints
 -   **Stack**: **Vite + React + TypeScript (TSX)**.
 -   **Styling**: TailwindCSS.
 -   **Audio**: Web Audio API (for pitch detection and playback).
 -   **Animation**: Framer Motion (for UI) + Canvas API (for audio visualization).
 -   **Local Only**: Ensure this runs perfectly on localhost.
