# Using the Agents

This file contains a high-level overview of these agents and how to get started using them quickly. However, you may find you want or need more guidance. In that case, see the AGENTS-DEEP-DEIVE.md file.

## Overview

This repo defines a set of `.agent.md` files that configure specialized AI personas ("agents") for a structured software delivery workflow. Each agent focuses on a specific phase or concern (planning, implementation, QA, UAT, DevOps, etc.), with clear responsibilities, constraints, and handoffs.

A typical high-level workflow looks like:

Orchestrator → Roadmap → Planner → (Analyst, Architect, Critic, Security) → Implementer → QA → UAT → DevOps → Retrospective → ProcessImprovement

**All agents use Flowbaby memory** via the `memory-contract` skill to provide long-running context across sessions. Agents function without Flowbaby but greatly benefit from its cross-session context. Install the [Flowbaby VS Code extension](https://github.com/groupzer0/flowbaby) to enable memory functions. 

## Where to Put These Files

There are two simple ways to make these agents available to VS Code:

1. **Per-workspace (recommended for a single project)**  
  Place the `.agent.md` files under `.github/agents/` in your repository. They will only apply to that workspace.

2. **User-level (available in every workspace)**  
  Place the `.agent.md` files in your [VS Code profile folder](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles). Paths by OS:
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\`

> [!TIP]
> The easiest way to create a user-level agent is via the Command Palette: **Chat: New Custom Agent** → select **User profile**. VS Code will place it in the correct location automatically.

3. **User/Prompts Folder (User-Global Scope)**
   Some users prefer to use the `prompts` folder within their user data directory. This functions similarly to profile-level agents but uses a specific folder convention.
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/Code/User/prompts/`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/prompts/`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\prompts\`

   To use this, simply place your `.agent.md` files (or `.prompt.md`) files in this directory. They will be available across all workspaces. This is useful for "global" agents that you want access to regardless of the specific project structure.

In this repo, the source copies live under `vs-code-agents/`; you can copy or sync from there into `.github/agents/` or your user-level folder.

For more guidance on GitHub Copilot agents in VS Code, see the official documentation: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents

## Using with GitHub Copilot CLI

These agents were originally written for GitHub Copilot in VS Code, but you can also use them with the GitHub Copilot CLI.

- Place your `.agent.md` files under `.github/agents/` in each repository where you run the CLI.
- Then invoke an agent with a command like:

```bash
copilot --agent planner --prompt "Create a plan for adding user authentication"
```

### Known limitation (user-level agents)

The Copilot CLI has a known upstream bug ([github/copilot-cli#452](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli/issues/452)) where **user-level agents in `~/.copilot/agents/` are not loaded**, even though they are documented. This behavior and workaround were originally reported and documented by @rjmurillo.

**Workaround:**

- Use per-repository agents under `.github/agents/` instead of relying on `~/.copilot/agents/`.
- If you prefer a single source of truth, you can keep your agents in one folder and copy or symlink them into each repo’s `.github/agents/` directory.

Once the upstream bug is fixed, this section can be updated to reflect the restored user-level behavior.

## Customizing Agents

Each `.agent.md` file defines:

- A **description** and **purpose**
- Allowed **tools** (editing files, running tests, using GitHub, etc.)
- **Handoffs** to other agents
- Detailed **responsibilities** and **constraints**

To customize:

- Edit the relevant `.agent.md` file to adjust:
  - Description and Purpose
  - Allowed tools
  - Handoff targets and prompts
- Keep responsibilities and constraints intact unless you intentionally want to change your development process (e.g., Planner must not edit code, QA owns test strategy docs, etc.).

Custom agents give you:

- **Separation of concerns**: planning vs coding vs QA vs UAT vs DevOps
- **Repeatable workflow**: each phase of work is clearly owned by one agent
- **Safety and clarity**: it's explicit who may edit what, and when

## Skills

Agents can load **Skills**—modular, reusable instruction sets that provide specialized knowledge on-demand. Skills are stored in the `vs-code-agents/skills/` directory.

### Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|  
| `memory-contract` | Unified Flowbaby memory retrieval/storage contract |
| `analysis-methodology` | Confidence levels, gap tracking, investigation techniques |
| `architecture-patterns` | ADR templates, patterns, anti-pattern detection |
| `code-review-checklist` | Pre/post-implementation review criteria |
| `cross-repo-contract` | Multi-repo API type safety and contract coordination |
| `document-lifecycle` | Unified numbering, automated closure, orphan detection |
| `engineering-standards` | SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS with detection patterns |
| `release-procedures` | Two-stage release workflow, semver, platform constraints |
| `security-patterns` | OWASP Top 10, language-specific vulnerabilities |
| `testing-patterns` | TDD workflow, test pyramid, coverage strategies |

### Skill Placement

Skills are placed in different directories depending on your VS Code version:

| Version | Location |
|---------|----------|
| **VS Code Stable (1.107.1)** | `.claude/skills/` |
| **VS Code Insiders** | `.github/skills/` |

> [!NOTE]
> These locations are changing with upcoming VS Code releases. The `.github/skills/` location is becoming the standard. Check the [VS Code Agent Skills documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills) for the latest guidance.

## Document Lifecycle Setup

Agents use a **unified numbering system** to track work across the entire pipeline. All documents in a work chain share the same ID for easy traceability.

### The `.next-id` File

Create a simple counter file to enable unified numbering:

```bash
echo "1" > agent-output/.next-id
```

**What it does:**
- When Analyst creates analysis `080`, Planner inherits `080` for the plan
- QA, UAT, Implementation all use `080` too
- Easy to follow: `analysis-080.md` → `plan-080.md` → `qa-080.md` → `uat-080.md`

**If you have existing plans:** Start with your highest plan number + 1:
```bash
echo "75" > agent-output/.next-id  # If your highest plan is 074
```

**How it works:**
1. Originating agents (Analyst, Planner) read the number, use it, then increment
2. Downstream agents (QA, UAT, Implementer) inherit the ID from their source document
3. Completed documents automatically move to `closed/` subfolders after commit

That's it! The agents handle the rest automatically.

## Agent-by-Agent Guide

### Orchestrator – Project Manager
**Role**: The central executive that drives the entire SDLC by coordinating specialist agents.

**Use when**:
- Starting a new feature or project.
- You want someone to manage the "big picture" and enforce the process.
- You need to resume work and want a status check.

**Example handoff prompts**:
- To Roadmap: "New initiative requested. Please evaluate strategic fit."
- To Planner: "Strategy approved. Please create detailed plan."

**Tips**:
- Start here! The Orchestrator knows who to call next.
- It manages `task.md` as the source of truth.

---

### Roadmap – Product Vision & Epics

**Role**: Owns product vision and outcome-focused epics, maintains the product roadmap.

**Use when**:
- Defining or revising product direction and epics
- Checking if a plan/feature still aligns with the Master Product Objective

**Example handoff prompts**:
- To Architect: "Epic requires architectural assessment and documentation before planning."
- To Planner: "Epic is ready for detailed implementation planning."

**Tips**:
- Talk about **user outcomes and business value**, not implementation details.
- Use Roadmap to sanity-check that a proposed change is actually worth building.

---

### Planner – High-Rigor Implementation Planning

**Role**: Turns roadmap epics into concrete, implementation-ready plans (WHAT/WHY, not HOW).

**Use when**:
- You have a feature/epic and need a structured plan before coding.
- Requirements or scope need to be clarified and broken into milestones.

**Example handoff prompts**:
- To Roadmap: "Validate that plan delivers epic outcomes defined in roadmap."
- To Architect: "Please review this plan to ensure it aligns with the architecture."
- To Analyst: "I've encountered technical unknowns that require deep investigation. Please analyze."
- To Critic: "Plan is complete. Please review for clarity, completeness, and architectural alignment."

**Tips**:
- Expect a **Value Statement** like: "As a [user] I want [objective] so that [value]."
- Planner writes **no code** and defines **no test cases**; it shapes the work for others.

---

### Analyst – Deep Technical/Context Research

**Role**: Investigates unknowns, APIs, performance questions, and tricky tradeoffs.

**Use when**:
- The Planner or Implementer hits technical uncertainty.
- You need API experiments, benchmarks, or comparative analysis.

**Example handoff-style prompts**:
- From Planner: "I've encountered technical unknowns that require deep investigation. Please analyze."
- From Implementer: "I've encountered technical unknowns during implementation. Please investigate."

**Tips**:
- Use Analyst to **de-risk decisions** before committing to an approach.
- Expect analysis docs that other agents then consume—not direct code changes.

---

### Architect – System & Design Decisions

**Role**: Maintains architecture, patterns, boundaries, and high-level design decisions.

**Use when**:
- A feature affects system structure, boundaries, or cross-cutting concerns.
- You need ADRs or architectural guidance for a plan.

**Example handoff prompts**:
- From Roadmap: "Epic requires architectural assessment and documentation before planning."
- From Planner: "Please review this plan to ensure it aligns with the architecture."
- From Retrospective: "Retrospective reveals architectural patterns that should be documented."

**Tips**:
- Use Architect to define **where** things live and how they interact, not the exact code.
- Have Architect bless or adjust big structural changes before coding.

---

### Critic – Plan Reviewer & Program Manager

**Role**: Critically reviews plans (and sometimes architecture/roadmap) before implementation.

**Use when**:
- A plan is "done" and you need a quality gate before implementation.

**Example handoff prompts**:
- To Planner: "Please revise the plan based on my critique findings."
- To Analyst: "Plan reveals research gaps or unverified assumptions. Please investigate."
- To Implementer: "Plan is sound and ready for implementation. Please begin implementation now."

**Tips**:
- Expect structured critiques focusing on **clarity, completeness, scope, and alignment**, not code style.
- Treat Critic as your pre‑implementation "red team" for plans.

---

### Implementer – Coding & Tests

**Role**: Writes and modifies code, implements the approved plan, and ensures tests exist and pass.

**Use when**:
- The plan has been approved and you’re ready to make code changes.
- You need to fix implementation issues uncovered by QA/UAT.

**Example handoff prompts**:
- To Analyst: "I've encountered technical unknowns during implementation. Please investigate."
- To Planner: "The plan has ambiguities or conflicts. Please clarify."
- To QA: "Implementation is complete. Please verify test coverage and execute tests."

**Tips**:
- Provide the **plan file path** and any existing analysis/architecture links.
- Expect the Implementer to: update code and tests, run tests, and produce an implementation doc—without editing QA/UAT docs directly.

---

### QA – Testing Strategy & Execution

**Role**: Designs test strategy, ensures coverage, and runs tests to validate technical quality.

**Use when**:
- You need a test plan before implementation.
- Implementation is done and you want a thorough technical test pass.

**Example handoff prompts**:
- To Planner: "Testing infrastructure is missing or inadequate. Please update plan to include required test frameworks, libraries, and configuration."
- To Implementer: "Implementation has test coverage gaps or test failures. Please address."
- To UAT: "Implementation is completed and QA passed. Please review."

**Tips**:
- QA focuses on **tests, coverage, and technical risk**, not business value.
- Use QA to design/execute tests and verify they’re meaningful, not just green.

---

### UAT – Product Owner / Value Validation

**Role**: Validates that implementation delivers the plan’s **value statement** and user outcomes.

**Use when**:
- QA is complete and you want to confirm that the feature actually solves the intended problem.

**Example handoff prompts**:
- To Planner: "Implementation does not deliver stated value. Plan revision may be needed."
- To Implementer: "Implementation has gaps in value delivery. Please address UAT findings."
- To DevOps: "Implementation complete with release decision. Please manage release steps."

**Tips**:
- UAT reads the plan’s value statement and **assesses code against that**, not just tests.
- Expect a clear decision: **APPROVED FOR RELEASE** or **NOT APPROVED**, with evidence.

---

### DevOps – Packaging & Release

**Role**: Ensures packaging/versioning is correct and executes releases (with explicit user approval).

**Use when**:
- QA and UAT are complete and you’re ready to prepare/publish a release.

**Example handoff prompts**:
- To Implementer: "Packaging issues or version mismatches detected. Please fix before release."
- To Retrospective: "Release complete. Please capture deployment lessons learned."

**Tips**:
- DevOps checks versions, packaging, tags, registry publish, etc.
- It **must** ask you for a final "yes" before releasing.

---

### Security – Security Audits & Guidance

**Role**: Security specialist reviewing plans and code for vulnerabilities and compliance.

**Use when**:
- A feature touches sensitive data, auth, or external interfaces.
- You want a targeted security audit or threat model.

**Example handoff prompts**:
- To Analyst: "Security finding requires deep technical investigation."
- To Planner: "Security risks require plan revision."
- To Implementer: "Security remediation requires code changes."

**Tips**:
- Use Security early (during planning/architecture) and again after implementation.
- Expect reports with prioritized risks and concrete remediation guidance.

---

### Retrospective – Lessons Learned

**Role**: Runs post‑implementation/post‑release retrospectives focusing on process, not blame.

**Use when**:
- A plan/feature has gone through QA, UAT, and (optionally) deployment.
- You want to understand what went well/poorly in your **workflow**.

**Example handoff prompts**:
- To Architect: "Retrospective reveals architectural patterns that should be documented."
- To Planner: "Retrospective identifies process improvements for future planning."
- To Roadmap: "Retrospective is closed for this plan. Please update the roadmap accordingly."

**Tips**:
- Use this to feed continuous improvement, not to fix code.
- Expect structured retrospectives and clear process-improvement candidates.

---

### ProcessImprovement – Evolving Agents & Workflow

**Role**: Reads retrospectives and updates the **agent instructions/workflow** (with your approval).

**Use when**:
- You have retrospectives and want to evolve how the agents work together.

**Example handoff prompt**:
- To Planner: "Previous work iteration is complete. Ready to start something new."

**Tips**:
- This is the only agent that should routinely edit `.agent.md` files (after you approve changes).
- Use it to keep your multi‑agent workflow sharp and aligned with real-world lessons.

---


## Putting It All Together

- Start with **Roadmap** for vision, then **Planner** for a concrete plan.
- Use **Architect / Analyst / Security / Critic** to refine and de‑risk the plan and architecture.
- Hand off to **Implementer** for code and tests, then **QA** for technical quality, **UAT** for value, **DevOps** for release.
- Afterward, let **Retrospective** and **ProcessImprovement** update how you work next time.
- **All agents use Flowbaby memory** via the `memory-contract` skill. Agents function without Flowbaby but greatly benefit from its cross-session context.
